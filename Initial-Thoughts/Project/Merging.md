## Project Merging

> A project can be uploaded to the cloud to merge (where exists) the local content with the cloud content. Where the project doesn't exist in the cloud the local copy matches the cloud copy and a new cloud copy is created. Subsequent local project changes can be merged to the cloud. Merging allows the system to allow the user to work on different nodes, enquiry types and trade packages.

> This merge process requires knowledge to understand (clumsy) the difference between the local copy and the cloud copy and the effects of the process. We do not allow the user to store notes of what they've done and why etc.

> The merge process is not automatic and so cloud backups etc. can not be maintained. Moving to another machine requires a cloud merge (i.e. computer failure would remove all non-synched data)

- The process needs to be automated whereby changes the user makes are merged back to the cloud where possible (connectivity etc.)
