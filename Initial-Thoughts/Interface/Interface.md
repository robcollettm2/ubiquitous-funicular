## Interface

>We currently have an issue where we want the application to be simple but want it's functionally to grow. This presents us with an issue where the interface is currently becoming busier to cope thus making the software less simple. 

>To somewhat manage this the interface is split in to modules suited to a particular task (bill production, rate pricing etc.). This means the user must move around screens to, sometimes, perform the simplest of tasks.

>Some elements of current ui is bespoke making the user 'learn' how something works.

To combat these issues:

- Simplify the process in to one screen along the lines of Microsoft Excel meaning the user doesn't have to jump between screens.
- Give the user the option to turn on/off groups of function ala Visual Studio panes.
  - A menu allowing the user to show/hide panels with like-minded functionality contained therein

- Consolidate core functionality (add,delete,cut,copy,paste)
- Rationalise functionality and remove functions where there is more one way to do it
- Use standard ui patterns/controls (i.e. don't create our own)
