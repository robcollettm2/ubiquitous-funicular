## Tags

The tag description editor should become rich text to enable richer content.

Currently tag types are 'soft' runtime fields which are determined via lookup. This can be quite costly as far as speed goes. The field should be a first class citizen allowing quick lookup/grouping etc.

The following tag types should be used (enum.). These types are only available to users where picking the correct tags for a particular function - i.e. showing the contacts within a Vendor.

- Project
- Item
- ItemResource
- VendorArea
- VendorContact
- VendorEnquiryType
- VendorTrade
- ItemResourceActivityCode
- ItemResourceCostCode
- Vendor
- ItemDim
- ItemResourceDim
- Node
- ActivityCode
- CostCode

These tags (and types) should be applied en masse if required.
