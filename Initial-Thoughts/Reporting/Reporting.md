## Reporting 

We currently have the publisher application which either generates letters (fixed page size etc.) or Excel spreadsheets. These are local. We also have the dashboard which gives us cross project stats.

Generally (other than CP3) we can not report cross-project. We can report cross-milestone. 

- The dashboard should become a window within the estimating application named 'Dashboard'
- This would mean it could be used standalone (as per publisher currently)
- For each report we should replicate an output window matching that report (i.e. tp1 would be a screen within the software which can also be exported to Excel, Web etc.)
- The window should be a combination of the dashboard and the publisher
  - Show stats across my hierarchy as per dashboard
  - Allow the user to show report screens and export as necessary
- current project notifications/statistics should be incorporated in to the main window of the dashboard window
