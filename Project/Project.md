## Project

> Currently a project can be created in the cloud and locally. Projects can be locally imported from many different sources. 

>A project can then be uploaded to the cloud to merge (where exists) the local content with the cloud content. Where the project doesn't exist in the cloud the local copy matches the cloud copy and a new cloud copy is created. Subsequent local project changes can be merged to the cloud. Merging allows the system to allow the user to work on different nodes, enquiry types and trade packages.

> This merge process requires knowledge to understand the difference between their local copy and the cloud copy and the effects of the process.

> The merge process is not automatic and so cloud backups etc. can not be maintained.
