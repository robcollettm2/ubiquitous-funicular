# Project Vendors

>We currently store a lot of project vendor properties which aren't used moving forward. The user tends to use the name of the vendor and it's email only.

* Remove address detail from project vendors and provide functionality to allow the user to lookup the address details from the cloud based on vendor name and email
* The user could be presented with a list of possible vendors (should more than one share the same name and email)
